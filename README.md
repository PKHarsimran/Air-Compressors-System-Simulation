# Air-Compressors-System-Simulation
Two air compressors supply air to an air supply tank. The air compressors will attempt to maintain a range of pressure in the tank ; the range is controlled by the operator. If the level goes below the low point of the range one compressor will start. If the high range isnâ€™t met after XXX seconds, a second air compressor will come on. All compressors will stop once the high range is met. The order of the compressor starts will depends on which compressor has the least of amount of run time (if two are tied AC-701 goes first). The compressor/air tank system will purge itself every ZZZ minutes. During a purge all compressors are turned off, valves V703 and V704 are closed the top relief valve is opened and the pressure drops down to XX psi. Once the purge is complete, V704 is closed, the tank is brought back into the range, and then V705 is opened.
